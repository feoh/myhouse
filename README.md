# Open Parlour

Open Parlour is software to create small, personal communities for everyone, by anyone.

## What does that *MEAN* exactly?

There are a million and one "Social networks" out there. Some commercial, some open source, but all of them are about broadcasting. Sharing your thoughts, words, pictures and feelings with as many others as you're comfortable (and in many cases for the commercial ones, more than you're comfortable with, because more sharing = more profit. That's not good for you, the user.)

Instead, Open Parlour is about creating a place where you can share with a community you define on your terms.

It also means that there will be a very low barrier for entry. Open Parlour is meant to run on pretty much any thing that computes and has a traditional filesystem that runs Python. It won't require any special technical skills, because it won't have any external dependencies. No database to maintain, no complex component configurations to set up. None of that. It's all self contained.

See the technical design for details on how I intend to make this possible.
